## How the Pomodoro Technique Works

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is named after the tomato-shaped timer used by its creator, Francesco Cirillo, to keep track of time.

The Pomodoro Technique works by helping users to focus on one task at a time for a set period of time, without distractions. This helps to improve productivity and reduce stress.

The Pomodoro Technique has four steps:

1. **Choose a task.** Decide on one task that you want to focus on for the next 25 minutes.
2. **Set a timer for 25 minutes.** Start the timer and focus on your task until the timer goes off.
3. **Take a short break.** When the timer goes off, take a short break of 5 minutes. Get up and move around, or do something else that will help you to clear your head.
4. **Repeat.** After your break, start the timer again and repeat steps 2 and 3 until your task is complete.
